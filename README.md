## Al Barrera, Engineering manager

I quit my job and my wife left me the house for a few days... so how did I decide to spend the extra free time before my new job starts?

I sat down and put together a combination REST server/in-memory DB in Golang, complete with sqlite back-ups, 80% test coverage, a Test Suite that can mock the database, and I even hooked it up to Github Actions for good measure. I blame the Pandemic...
